# Challenge
    - Create a simple a project and task management web application. Think of an extremely simplified version of Teamwork or Asana. The components are:
    - A landing page which lists projects and has the options to create new projects, and edit and delete existing projects
    - Projects have a name, description, duration, and avatar (image) and can be viewed/edited from their own uniquely addressed details page.
    - The project details page also lists tasks associated with this project and has the options to create new tasks, and edit and delete existing tasks
    - Tasks have a name, description, start and end dates and can be viewed/edited from their own uniquely addressed details page. Ideally, tasks URLs are nested within project URLs (i.e. “.../project/5/task/3”)

#How run
